Hello, I am a professional software engineer with great expertise in web programming & blockchain application development. I'm actively providing challenging & business-oriented projects for my clients. I had supervised 100+ academic projects (60+ Laravel & 40+ Nodejs) & completed 85+ professional projects for the local & international marketplace. It's been five years since I'm working in this domain.
